      I am a civil engineer with a passion for structural designing. I have a background in engineering, science, and mathematics, and I have a strong interest in the intersection of structural efficiency and practicality. I am actively seeking for employment and open to any work related to civil and structural engineering, green energy, sustainable mining, and software development bootcamps.

      While I wait for employment, I currently work as an AI trainer and also actively upgrading my skils.
